# NASounds-lit-hits
NASounds is a SPA that randomly maps a NASA soundbyte with a key on your keyboard. Randomly press keys or create your own space-based music. 

### Installation

NASounds is written in Flask and depends on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/#install) and the [SoundCloud API](https://github.com/soundcloud/soundcloud-python) (as well as, a few builtin libraries like os and json). Because of this you'll have to prepare your environment, thankfully all of these libraries are available via [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)!

### Setup

Once the dependancies are installed the site can be run using the command
```
user@computer:~/NASounds-lit-hits$ python nasounds.py
```
and then accessing http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or whatever IP address and port that your terminal emulator tells you Flask is serving the site on).

### Usage

Just press some keys!!
